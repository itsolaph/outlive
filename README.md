# Outlive

Outlive is an NFT that owns a transferable service instance of a running paid API: the vault that
holds its treasury, price list, customer ledger and worker key is a NEAR sub-account the token
controls. Selling the token moves that instance to the buyer while customers keep calling it.
One token is one running service; the contract that issues them is called the Outlive contract,
and that name is used throughout the code and the docs.
The demo service is a durable webhook relay that agents pay per delivery; the demo buyer is
itself an agent that attributes the vault's on-chain revenue to independent customers, computes
payback on chain-visible costs, and buys. Testnet only. Built for the NEAR hackathon (November
2026), tracks `nfts` and `business`.

**Other entry by the same author.** [RehearseGate](https://github.com/itsolaph/rehearse-gate) (track
`security`) is a separate project submitted to the same hackathon: an on-chain gate that lets a NEAR
contract upgrade only with a signed PASS receipt from an off-chain rehearsal. It shares no code
with Outlive.

**In the real world.** Picture a vending machine on a good corner. You can copy the machine in an
afternoon; you cannot copy the corner, the four years of people walking past it, or the till it
fills. Software has no resale value for exactly that reason: the code is the machine and the
customers are the corner, so a buyer can get one but never the other. Outlive sells the corner with
the machine — one token, one running service, its customers and its till. The film makes this
concrete with generated footage of a machine on a pavement, then redraws it as a line plate.

## Try it

Hosted demo: <https://itsolaph.github.io/outlive/> (static page, reads testnet directly, no backend of
ours in the path). Ninety-four-second film, cut 4:5 so it reads on a phone and on a desktop,
subtitled. The vending-machine shots are generated film and are labelled as such in frame; every
number in it comes from a recorded testnet run:
[docs/media/outlive-demo.mp4](docs/media/outlive-demo.mp4) ·
[poster](docs/media/outlive-poster.jpg) ·
[subtitles](docs/media/outlive-demo.srt).
A 71-second launch film, also 4:5 and subtitled, tells the same story as an ad: a business that is sold
while it keeps serving customers, not a password handover. Its b-roll is AI-generated illustration and
is stamped as such; the product screens are captured from the hosted app, and the figures are labelled
live or recorded run. [film](docs/media/outlive-ad.mp4) ·

| Do | See | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `npm ci && bash scripts/check.sh` | Contract wasm builds, 41 passing contract unit tests (plus one ignored SVG preview), 19 sandbox integration tests (near-workspaces), the Node suites and the web build pass; ends with `== all checks passed`. `SKIP_SANDBOX=1` skips the sandbox tests (they download `neard` once). | 3 to 6 min |
| `npm run build && node agents/dist/src/buyer.js --account <any testnet account> --dry-run` | Read only; no customer or buyer key is needed for a dry run. The buyer agent prints its policy (strict by default), then evaluates each current listing on `outlive3.outlive.testnet`: attributed revenue, payback on chain-visible costs, and each pass/FAIL reason. Listings come and go as demos run; `no listings found` is a valid result. A short demo does not satisfy the strict policy. | 15 s |
| `node examples/customer.mjs --account <you>.testnet`, then `--fund 2` | Become a paying customer of the hosted relay: HTTP 402 with the exact payment call, then mint test tUSDC, prepay, a signed receipt and a signed delivery proof. See [docs/TRY-AS-CUSTOMER.md](docs/TRY-AS-CUSTOMER.md). | 10 min |
| `npm run dev -w web`, open http://127.0.0.1:7650 | Every token with live figures and its on-chain certificate. Open one for its earnings history per holder, its customers (our demo traffic agents marked), and for a listing the payback on chain-visible costs with the worked formula. Connect a testnet wallet to buy, list, withdraw, rotate the worker or manage relay credit. `npm run build -w web` writes a static site to `web/dist/`. | 1 min |
| Open a token in the web app and connect a testnet wallet that owns it; otherwise stay disconnected or connect another account | The holder console in the token detail: withdraw revenue, rotate the worker, list/set config and manage customer credit and refunds. Without the holder wallet it shows "Holder console - locked", the owner read live with `nft_token`, and a hint to connect as that account. | 2 min |
| Open `deployments/testnet.json` | Every recorded testnet run with transaction links: `demo`, `hostileSeller`, `washReject`. | |
| `bash scripts/demo-testnet.sh` (funded accounts, see below) | The whole story on testnet: worker A and traffic, revenue ticking, listing, the buyer agent (demo policy, printed) buying, the seller's withdraw reverting, worker B taking over, open deliveries delivered, the buyer withdrawing. Prints a link at every step, ends with `Demo passed`, stops every process it started. | 8 to 16 min |
| `bash scripts/hostile-seller.sh` | The seller kills its worker with SIGKILL after the sale, with jobs in flight. Prints jobs in flight at the kill, delivered by the buyer's worker, refunded, and double charges (0), each with links. | about 20 min (10 are the refund delay) |
| `node scripts/wash-reject.mjs` | The seller pays its own vault through two accounts it funded; the buyer agent, even with the demo policy, answers SKIP: "revenue from owner-funded customers excluded". | 4 min |
| `node scripts/theft-proof.mjs` | Six unauthorized actions against the hosted vault (worker key withdraws, sends NEAR, adds a full-access key, calls the token; a stranger withdraws; an old worker key charges), each rejected on testnet. Needs the vault's worker key file, so it runs on the operator's machine. | 30 s |
| `node agents/dist/src/withdraw-xchain.js --vault <vault> --to eth:usdc --recipient 0x...` | A NEAR Intents 1Click mainnet dry quote (`dry: true`), nothing executed, for paying vault revenue out to another chain, and the exact `withdraw` call it would make. | 5 s |
| `bash scripts/smoke-testnet.sh` | The contract-only story on testnet (mint, charge, list, buy, rotate) with assertions. | 3 min |

Toolchain (pinned): Node 22 or newer (tested with 26.12), npm, TypeScript 5.9.3, near-api-js
7.4.0, Vite 7.3.7. Contracts: Rust stable (tested with 1.99) with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
target, `cargo-near` 0.22.0, near-sdk 5.30.0, near-workspaces 0.24.0. `near` CLI: near-cli-rs
0.30 (only to create accounts). Settings the scripts read are listed in
[`.env.example`](.env.example); copy it to `.env` (git-ignored) or export them. Keys never go
there: they stay in the near-cli legacy keychain (`~/.near-credentials/testnet/<account>.json`).

The testnet scripts need accounts with keys in that keychain: a seller with about 3.5 NEAR
(each run mints a new token for 2.88 NEAR; use a fresh one per run) and a buyer, alice and bob
with about 1 NEAR each. Create them with
`near account create-account sponsor-by-faucet-service <name>.testnet autogenerate-new-keypair save-to-legacy-keychain network-config testnet create`
and pass them as `DEMO_SELLER`, `DEMO_BUYER`, `DEMO_ALICE`, `DEMO_BOB` (or `HOSTILE_SELLER`,
`WASH_SELLER`). tUSDC is minted for them automatically (anyone can mint up to 1,000 per call).
The scripts reach the public testnet RPC and the FastNEAR transaction index; set `NEAR_RPC_URLS`
if you have your own RPC.

## Claims and proof

Timecodes below refer to the 82-second film in `docs/media`. Where the film does not show a claim, the cell
says so: the transaction or the test is the evidence, not the video.
The main and wash recordings preceded the concurrent-admission fix; they demonstrate sale,
appraisal and owner-funded-revenue rejection, not universal absence of duplicate charges.
The corrected hostile-seller run and regression tests are the evidence for that fix.

## Track requirements (nfts)

- [x] **NEP-171 contract and the token → sub-account link.** `contracts/outlive/src/nft.rs` implements NEP-171 (`nft_transfer`, `nft_transfer_call`, `nft_token`); `contracts/outlive/src/mint.rs` derives `vault_id = <token_id>.<outlive>` and creates that sub-account in the same mint batch; views in `contracts/outlive/src/views.rs`.
- [x] **Control passes on transfer and the old owner cannot keep access.** `contracts/outlive/src/ownership.rs` bumps `owner_epoch` and pushes the new owner to the vault after every transfer/sale; every owner method starts with `assert_owner` against that pushed owner in `contracts/vault/src/owner.rs`, so the old account's withdraw/rotate calls revert. Sandbox tests: `contracts/tests/tests/integration/ownership.rs`, `sale.rs`, `owner_powers.rs`.
- [x] **Holder-gated page (the new console).** `web/src/gate.ts` (`isHolder`, 4 cases in `web/test/gate.test.ts`); `web/src/main.ts` reads the live owner with `nft_token(token_id)` and renders either the holder actions or the locked card.
- [x] **Per-NFT history: what it earned, what it paid out, who held it.** `sdk/src/history.ts` builds ownership epochs from the vault's NEP-297 events; `web/src/earnings.ts` reads the index and `web/src/main.ts` renders the ledger. Test: `sdk/test/history.test.ts` (recorded fixture under `sdk/test/fixtures/`).
- [x] **Transfer-path tests, including a sale with a payout in flight.** `contracts/tests/tests/integration/sale.rs` and `ownership.rs`; `scripts/hostile-seller.sh` sells the token mid-run, then kills worker A with jobs in flight. Recorded run `hostile-11060310` in `deployments/testnet.json` (`hostileSeller`) reports 0 double charges and is summarized in [`docs/DEMO.md`](docs/DEMO.md#hostile-seller).

## NEAR features used

| Feature | Where it is exercised |
|---|---|
| NEP-171 core, NEP-177 metadata, NEP-181 enumeration | `contracts/outlive/src/nft.rs`, `contracts/outlive/src/views.rs`; every mint and sale |
| NEP-297 events (`outlive_*`, `vault_*`, NEP-171 and NEP-141 events) | `contracts/outlive/src/events.rs`, `contracts/vault/src/events.rs`; read back by `sdk/src/history.ts` (earnings history) and `sdk/src/appraisal.ts` (per-customer revenue, who paid credit in) |
| NEP-413 signed messages for API authentication | `sdk/src/nep413.ts`, `worker/src/auth.ts`; every relay request |
| NEP-141 `ft_transfer_call` as the payment path (customer credit, token purchase), NEP-145 storage, NEP-148 metadata | `contracts/vault/src/customer.rs`, `contracts/outlive/src/sale.rs`, `contracts/tusdc/src/lib.rs`, `sdk/src/client.ts` |
| Sub-accounts created by a contract (one vault per token, created, deployed and initialized in one batch) | `contracts/outlive/src/mint.rs` |
| Function-call access keys (the worker key may only call `charge` on the vault; the vault adds and deletes it itself) | `contracts/vault/src/owner.rs` (`set_worker`), `worker/src/vault-chain.ts`, `scripts/theft-proof.mjs` |
| Dynamic NFT metadata (on-chain SVG certificate built from pushed stats) | `contracts/outlive/src/svg.rs`, `contracts/vault/src/hooks.rs` (`push_stats`) |
| NEAR Intents 1Click API, mainnet dry quotes only (`dry: true`, nothing executed): fund a purchase from another chain, pay revenue out to another chain | `agents/src/oneclick.ts`, `agents/src/buyer.ts`, `agents/src/withdraw-xchain.ts` |
| NEAR Connect wallet connector | `web/src/wallet.ts` |

Not used: gas keys (NEP-611), global contracts (NEP-591), Chain Signatures. See "Limits".

## Not claimed

- No NEAR Intents payment was executed. Every 1Click result here is a mainnet dry quote
  (`dry: true`); nothing was deposited, swapped or sent.
- No TEE. The worker's image hash in the vault is a published claim, not attested.
- No Chain Signatures.
- Testnet only, with a test token (tUSDC) anyone can mint.
- Traffic in the recorded demos comes from the project's own agents (`outlive-alice`,
  `outlive-bob`, and accounts funded by `outlive-seller*`, `outlive-hostile` and `outlive-wash`) unless shown otherwise; the
  web app marks them. The payback figures in the demos are figures of that traffic, not evidence
  of demand.
- Payback is payback on chain-visible costs: revenue minus on-chain gas. Hosting, bandwidth and
  operator time are not included.
- The worker is trusted off-chain software. It can take a paid job and not deliver it; signed
  receipts and missing proofs make that visible, daily caps and refunds limit it, and nothing
  on chain prevents it. A buyer gets the vault, not the servers, domains or code.
- The token is a transferable service instance, not a legal transfer of a business.
- "Six unauthorized actions rejected on testnet" covers those six actions; it is not a proof
  that no other path exists, and the contracts have had no independent audit.
- The contract account still has an operator full-access key during preparation. Removing it
  and recording the DeleteKey transaction is a pre-submission gate, not a completed claim;
  see `deployments/testnet.json` `outliveKeys`. Vault sub-accounts are a separate, keyless case.

## How it works

```
 seller / buyer --- NEP-171 token ---> Outlive contract ---- owner push (epoch) ----> vault <slug>.<outlive>
                    built-in sale       (registry,          lock / unlock            treasury, price,
                    ft_transfer_call     factory, sale,                              customer ledger,
                    {"buy": ...}         dynamic NFT)  <---- on_stats -------------  worker key
                                                                                        ^
 customers (SDK) -- NEP-413 signed request --> worker (gateway + relay + charger) -------+ charge,
                <-- 402 / receipt / proofs --       signs as the vault with a            signed as the
                                                    function-call key limited to charge   vault
```

1. `mint` on the Outlive contract creates the vault sub-account `<slug>.<outlive>` in one batch
   (create account, deploy the vault code, init) and mints the token only after that succeeded.
   The vault has no full-access key, ever.
2. Customers prepay credit in the payment token (`ft_transfer_call` to the vault) and call the
   worker with NEP-413 signed requests. Unknown or unfunded customers get HTTP 402 with the exact
   call to make.
3. The worker accepts a delivery, signs an obligation receipt, delivers with retries, signs a
   proof of every attempt, and charges the vault in batches with its function-call key. Charges
   move credit to revenue within each customer's balance and daily cap.
4. The token holder withdraws revenue. Listing the token locks the vault (no withdraw, no key
   rotation, no price change). A buyer pays through `ft_transfer_call` on the payment token; the
   token moves the token, pushes the new owner to the vault and pays the seller.
5. From the next charge on, revenue belongs to the buyer and the seller's withdraw reverts. The
   buyer starts a worker and rotates the worker key and endpoint in one transaction. The old
   worker sees it on chain, hands its open obligations to the new endpoint and exits. If the
   seller kills it instead, customers present their receipts to the new endpoint themselves.

More detail: [docs/DESIGN.md](docs/DESIGN.md) (design, buyer appraisal, hostile seller, threat
model), [docs/CONTRACTS.md](docs/CONTRACTS.md) (every method and invariant),
[docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md) (the runs step by step), [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md),
[docs/ENGINEERING-REVIEW.md](docs/ENGINEERING-REVIEW.md) (core fixes, executed checks and remaining boundaries),
[docs/TRY-AS-CUSTOMER.md](docs/TRY-AS-CUSTOMER.md).

Running a worker yourself: `node worker/dist/src/cli.js --vault <vault> --network testnet --port 7601`.
It reads price, endpoint, worker key and payment token from chain and refuses to start unless
its key file holds the vault's registered worker key.

## What moves with the token

Enforced by the contracts, so it moves without trusting the seller:

- **Treasury.** Withdrawable proceeds stay in the vault and belong to whoever holds the token.
- **Price list.** The price per call; increases take effect only after a 24-hour notice.
- **Customer ledger.** Every customer's prepaid credit, daily cap and sequence number. Customer
  credit is a liability, never withdrawable by the owner; customers can always take it back
  after the refund delay (10 minutes).
- **Worker authorization.** The only key on the vault is the worker's function-call key. The
  token holder replaces it; the old key is deleted in the same step.

Not enforced, and said plainly:

- **The hosting.** Servers, domains, code and uptime are off chain. After a sale the seller's
  worker keeps serving (for the buyer's revenue) until the buyer rotates the key, or the seller
  kills it; see [the hostile-seller analysis](docs/DESIGN.md#hostile-seller-the-old-worker-is-killed-not-handed-off).
- **The image hash** in the vault is a published claim about the worker code, not verified.
- **Delivery.** A worker can take a paid delivery and not deliver it. Signed receipts and
  proofs make that visible, caps and refunds limit it.

## Testnet deployment

| | |
|---|---|
| Outlive contract | [`outlive3.outlive.testnet`](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/outlive3.outlive.testnet) |
| Payment token (tUSDC, test only) | [`tusdc.outlive.testnet`](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/tusdc.outlive.testnet) |
| Hosted relay (customer quickstart) | [`relay-live.outlive3.outlive.testnet`](https://testnet.nearblocks.io/address/relay-live.outlive3.outlive.testnet); endpoint in its `get_info` |
| Code hashes | in [`deployments/testnet.json`](deployments/testnet.json); `vault_code_hash()` on the token returns the hash every vault runs |

The recorded runs, with every transaction, are in `deployments/testnet.json` (`demo`,
`hostileSeller`, `washReject`) and summarized in [docs/DEMO.md](docs/DEMO.md).

## Limits

- Testnet only, with a test token. Nothing here has been audited; the contract review in
  [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) is a self-review.
- One worker per vault at a time, one charge transaction at a time (a single access key nonce).
  NEP-611 gas keys would allow parallel charge lanes; they are not used yet because a gas key
  holds its own NEAR balance that the vault would have to fund and refill.
- Each vault is a full contract deployment (about 2.3 NEAR of storage). NEP-591 global
  contracts would make vaults cheap at scale, but publishing one costs about 10 NEAR per 100 KB
  once, so for a handful of tokens per-vault deployment is cheaper.
- Wash revenue: the buyer agent excludes owners, previous owners and customers they funded (one
  hop) and wants several independent payers, but funding through intermediaries or recruited
  third parties is not caught.
- The demo policy relaxes the buyer's thresholds so a 10-minute run can buy; the agent prints
  that every time. With the default strict policy no demo vault would be bought.
- Deliveries are at least once: after a handover a delivery can reach its target twice. It is
  never charged twice.
- A job charged by a worker that was then killed is made good only if the customer still has
  its receipt; there is no on-chain clawback.

## Roadmap

- Mainnet with native USDC and the token account locked (no full-access key) or DAO-controlled.
- TEE-attested workers, so the image hash becomes a verified fact instead of a claim.
- An uptime bond the owner posts in the vault, slashed when signed receipts show unserved work.
- NEP-591 global contracts for vault code once there are many tokens; NEP-611 gas keys for
  parallel charge lanes.
